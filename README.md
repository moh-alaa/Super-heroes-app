# Super-heroes-app
A simple APP to show Super Heroes from superheroapi.com

## How to start
1- Clone the project into your local.

2- Run ```bash yarn install ```

3- After ```bash yarn start ```

## Note
I haven't use .env to handle the API live/local URL. so no need to worry about it. the urls can be found in the [constants](https://github.com/moh-alaa/super-heroes-app/blob/main/src/utils/constants.js) file.
